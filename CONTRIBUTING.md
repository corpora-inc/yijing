There are many ways to contribute to I-Ching:

*   **üíª Writing code:** If you want to fix a bug or implement a new feature, follow the steps below.

## Getting started
*(For more details, see the [README.md](README.md#üõ†Ô∏è-development-setup)).*

1.  **Ensure you have the prerequisites** 
2.  **Fork the repository** on GitHub.
3.  **Clone your fork** locally:
    ```bash
    git clone <github link>
    ```
4.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
5.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run tauri dev
    ```


## Making changes

1.  **Create a new branch** for your changes. Use a descriptive name, like `fix/login-bug` or `feature/add-search-bar`.
    ```bash
    git checkout -b <branch-name>
    ```
2.  **Make your code changes.**
    *   Follow the existing coding style and conventions.
    *   Ensure your code is well-commented where necessary.
    *   If adding new features, consider if unit tests are applicable.
    *   Update documentation (like the README) if your changes affect setup, usage, or features.
3.  **Test your changes** thoroughly. Ensure the development server runs without errors and the website behaves as expected. Check the build process:
    ```bash
    npm run tauri build
    ```
4.  **Commit your changes.** Write clear and concise commit messages. Follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification if possible (e.g., `fix: correct typo in header`, `feat: implement dark mode toggle`).
    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "feat: Describe your feature"
    ```

## Submitting a Pull Request (PR)

1.  **Push your branch** to your fork on GitHub:
    ```bash
    git push origin <branch-name>
    ```
2.  **Open a Pull Request** from your fork's branch to the `main` branch of the `corpora-inc/corpora-main-page` repository.
3.  **Create a description**  Clearly describe the problem you are solving and the changes you made.
    *   Link to any relevant issues (e.g., "Closes #123").
    *   Include screenshots or GIFs if your changes affect the UI.
4.  **Request reviews** if needed, or wait for maintainers to review your PR.
5.  **Respond to feedback** and make necessary changes. Push updates to your branch; the PR will update automatically.
6.  Once your PR is approved and passes any automated checks, a maintainer will merge it.

## Issue and Pull Request labels

We may use labels to categorize issues and PRs (e.g., `bug`, `enhancement`, `documentation`, `help wanted`). This helps organize tasks and guide contributors.
