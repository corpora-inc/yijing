## üõ†Ô∏è Development Setup

### **Prerequisites:**

1. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS version recommended) & npm

   > **Recommended:** use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to install and manage Node versions.

   #### Install nvm (if you don‚Äôt have it)

   ```bash
   /usr/bin/curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.4/install.sh | bash
   ```

   #### Restart your shell, then:

   ```bash
   nvm install --lts
   nvm use --lts
   ```

   Or install Node LTS via your OS package manager:

   - **macOS:**
     ```bash
     brew install node
     ```
   - **Debian/Ubuntu:**
     ```bash
     sudo apt update
     ```
     ```bash
     sudo apt install nodejs npm
     ```
   - **Windows (with Chocolatey):**
     ```bash
     choco install nodejs-lts -y
     ```

   Make sure you have at least **Node 16**.

2. [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) & Cargo

   #### Fetch and run the official installer

   ```bash
   curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
   ```

   #### In your shell (or reopen it):

   ```bash
   source ~/.cargo/env
   ```

   #### Make sure you‚Äôre up to date

   ```bash
   rustup update
   ```

3.  [Tauri Prerequisites](https://tauri.app/v1/guides/getting-started/prerequisites) (Ensure you follow the setup for your specific Operating System, including mobile development requirements if applicable).

    Tauri needs some native toolkits to build its WebView.

    #### macOS

    ##### Xcode Command-Line Tools

    ```bash
    xcode-select --install
    ```

    #### Ubuntu / Debian

    ```bash
    sudo apt install -y build-essential pkg-config libgtk-3-dev libwebkit2gtk-4.0-dev
    ```

    #### Fedora / RHEL
    ```bash
    sudo dnf install -y gcc-c++ make pkgconfig gtk3-devel webkit2gtk3-devel
    ```

    #### Windows

    1.  **Visual Studio 2022 Build Tools**
        - Download & install the ‚ÄúDesktop development with C++‚Äù workload (include Windows 10+ SDK).
    2.  **Windows SDK** (if not bundled)
    3.  **(Optional) Python 2** for some Node native modules:
        ```bash
        choco install python2 -y
        ```
    4.  Ensure your toolchain target is set:
        ```bash
        rustup default stable-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc
        ```


### Enviroment setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/corpora-inc/yijing.git
    cd yijing
    ```
2.  **Install frontend dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  **Run in development mode (Desktop):**
    ```bash
    npm run tauri dev
    ```
    This will open the app in a development window with hot-reloading for the frontend.
4.  **Build the application (Desktop):**
    ```bash
    npm run tauri build
    ```
    Find the installers/binaries in `src-tauri/target/release/bundle/`.
5.  **Mobile Development:**
    - Refer to the official [Tauri Mobile documentation](https://tauri.app/v1/guides/mobile/) for detailed instructions on setting up emulators/simulators and running/building for iOS and Android.
    - Common commands: `npm run tauri android dev`, `npm run tauri ios dev`, `npm run tauri android build`, `npm run tauri ios build`.

#### Tips & gotchas

- **Updating Tauri:** upgrade both the CLI and the core crates in lockstep:
  cargo install tauri-cli --force
  npm install @tauri-apps/cli@latest
- **Troubleshooting:**
  - On macOS, if the build fails in `cocoa`, make sure Xcode tools are current.
  - On Windows, double-check that the MSVC toolchain is active (`rustup show`).
